      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>InterMatch is a dedicated platform connecting students and young professionals with internship opportunities under various Prime Minister schemes. Our goal is to make skill development and practical experience accessible, relevant, and tailored to each individual.

We simplify the process of discovering government-backed programs, ensuring that every opportunity leads to meaningful learning and growth.

At InterMatch, we don’t just list internships—we create pathways for students to gain experience, build confidence, and shape their future careers..</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
